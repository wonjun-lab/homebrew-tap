#
# The source of truth is packaging/homebrew/codex-swap.rb in the codex-swap repository;
# this copy is what Homebrew reads. Update both with each release.
#
# `codex` itself is not a dependency: it is distributed through npm, and depending on it
# here would drag a whole node toolchain in for a tool that only ever shells out to it.
# `codex-swap doctor` says so plainly if it is missing.

    <<~EOS
      codex-swap reads usage by running the codex CLI, so install that too:
        npm install -g @openai/codex

      Then check everything is reachable:
        codex-swap doctor
    EOS
  end

    # `list` on an empty config must not fail: a fresh machine has no slots yet, and a
    # formula test that needs credentials is a test that never runs in CI.
